# 01 — Color Space + Histogram Processing (MATLAB)

This module demonstrates core Digital Image Processing operations on a single RGB image:

- RGB channel separation (R/G/B)
- HSV conversion and channel visualization (H/S/V)
- 2× upscaling followed by center-cropping back to original size
- Grayscale conversion + histogram plotting
- Histogram matching (grayscale image matched to reference distribution)

## How to Run

1. Place your input image at:
   - `input/image.png`

2. Open MATLAB, set the Current Folder to this directory, and run:
   ```matlab
   main
