Write a MATLAB script to complete the following tasks:
• Load the image ‘onion.png’ and convert it into a grayscale image
• Equalize the histogram of the grayscale image using function histeq 
• Write a histogram stretching function for processing color images
• Display the input image, the equalized image, and the histogram stretched image in
  one figure 
• Display all channels of the color image ‘onion.png’ separately but in one figure 
• Convert the color image ‘onion.png’ into HSV color space using function rgb2hsv
  and display all channels separately but in one figure 
• Convert the color image ‘onion.png’ into YIQ color space using the function rgb2ntsc
  and display all channels separately but in one figure 
• Write a function to change all the pixels that have a color other than red from the
  color image ‘onion.png’ to black and display the output image
