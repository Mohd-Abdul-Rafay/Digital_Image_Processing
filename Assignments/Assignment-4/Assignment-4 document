Write a MATLAB script to complete the following tasks:
• Load the image ‘onion.png’ and convert it into a grayscale image, denoted with img1.
• Apply Fourier transform to img1 and the Fourier coefficient matrix is denoted with
freq1 
• Display both the magnitude and phase components of freq1. 
• Remove the low-frequency components from freq1 and save the result into freq2.
Reconstruct an image (imgR) from freq2. Note that you need to specify the threshold
of low frequency 
• Display the reconstructed image imgR 
• Construct and apply a low-pass spatial filter to img1 to generate an image imgR2 that
is similar to imgR 
• Compute the pixel-to-pixel absolute difference between the spatial filtering result and
imgR and display the difference image
