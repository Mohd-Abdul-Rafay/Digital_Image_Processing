Write a MATLAB script to complete the following tasks:
• Load the image ‘peppers.png’ and denote it as img1.
• Rotate the img1 by a random degree in the range of 10 to 40. The rotated image is
  denoted as img2.
• Crop img2 into a smaller image of size 50 by 50 pixels, denoted as img3. The cropped
  image should be at (or close to) the center of img2. 
• Write a function position=reg(img1, img3) to register img1 and img3. Hint: Use 2D
  cross-correlation (corr2(A, B)) to compute the best match. 
  o Note that nested for loops can be used to explore all combinations of
    translation and rotation.
  o When corr2 is used, the two inputs must be of the same size.
  o A matrix can be created to hold the cross-correlation value of different
    combinations. The maximum value of this cross-correlation matrix indicates
    the best alignment (registration).
• Display the transformed img3 over image img1. Hint: use function imshowpair(A,
  B ,"blend") and the blend option overlay one image on top of the other.
