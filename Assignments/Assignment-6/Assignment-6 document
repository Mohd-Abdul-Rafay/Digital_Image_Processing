Write a MATLAB script to complete the following tasks:
• Load the image ‘cell.tif’, denoted with img1.
• Use Sobel edge detector to detect the object boundaries. Tune the threshold to get the
  boundary as well as the internal texture. Display the result image. An example is
  shown below.
• Implement one or more structuring elements to dilate the edge map. Hint: MATLAB
  functions strel and imdilate create structuring element and apply dilation. Line
  structuring elements with different orientations can be used. The result image may
  look like the following.
• Fill the holes within the objects using imfill function.
• Smooth the object using erosion operator with a diamond structuring element and
  display the result image.
