Write a MATLAB script to complete the following tasks:
• Load the images ‘bricks.jpg’,‘bricksRotated.jpg’,‘carpet.jpg’, and ‘rice.png’. 
  Crop a 128 by 128 image from each image and put the cropped images into a three-
  dimensional array (name it img1). Rotate the input images by 45 degrees, crop a 128
  by 128 image from each rotated image, and put the cropped images into img1. The
  size of img1 is 128 by 128 by 8, where 8 is the number of cropped images.
• Write a function sim=LBP2(imgA, imgB) to extract the local binary pattern from
  both imgA and imgB and create a similarity score from the local binary pattern, e.g.,
  using Euclidean distance. The function returns the similarity score (sim) of the two
  input images.
  o Call MATLAB function extractLBPFeatures to extract the local binary pattern
    from each image.
• Evaluate all images in img1 and identify the most similar ones to the cropped image
  of ‘bricks.jpg’ before the 45-degree rotation.
