Write a MATLAB script to complete the following tasks:
• Load the image ‘onion.png’ and convert it into a grayscale image, denoted with
  ‘img1’.
• Develop a function ‘myConv’ to perform convolution. The function takes two inputs:
  an image and a convolution kernel. If the image is a color image, perform convolution
  only to the intensity channel. The function returns the convolution result. An optional
  function parameter is the padding method. 
• Create a copy of the clean grayscale image, denoted with ‘img2’, in the memory and
  add salt and pepper noise to it using imnoise 
• Remove salt and pepper noise using function medfilt2 and display the clean (img1)
  and denoised image side by side (using subplot function) 
• Create a copy of the clean grayscale image, denoted with ‘img3’, in the memory and
  add Gaussian noise using imnoise. Remove Gaussian noise using imgaussfilt and save
  the result in ‘img4’ 
• Apply ‘myConv’ using an average filter to remove noise from ‘img3’ and save the
  result image in ‘img5’. Display img4 and img5 side by side 
• Extract edges from img2 and img5 and display the results side by side.
