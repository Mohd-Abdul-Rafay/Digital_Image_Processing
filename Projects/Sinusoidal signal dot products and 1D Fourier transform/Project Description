Sinusoid signal dot products and 1D Fourier transform: develop a program to achieve the following functions:
• A GUI to allow user interactions for specifying operations and arguments, and visualizing the outputs,
• Creating and displaying two sinusoid signals and drawing sample points of both signals at an even spacing;
• Displaying the sample points on top of the signals and computing the products;
• Displaying the value of integration of the products;
• Loading a user-specified signal (e.g., recording a voice signal) and applying the 1D Fourier transform to this signal
