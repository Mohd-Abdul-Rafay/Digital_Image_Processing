Write a MATLAB program to complete the following tasks:
• Read an image into the workspace (e.g., using MATLAB function imread) and display
  the image (e.g., using MATLAB function imshow). The image file name should be
  image.png and there is no need to submit the image. 
• Display each channel of this image in a separate figure (window). 
• Convert the color image into HSV color space (e.g., using rgb2hsv) and display each
  channel in a separate figure. Note the channels are the HSV channels.
• Enlarge the image two times (e.g., using the function imresize) and crop the enlarged
  image to its original size (e.g., using the function imcrop) 
• Convert the color image into grayscale (e.g., using function rgb2gray) 
• Generate the histogram of the grayscale image and display it on screen 
• Write a function to achieve histogram matching (hint: use MATLAB built-in function
  histeq as the starting point)
  − The function takes two input images (either color or grayscale images) and uses the
    histogram of one image as the reference to modify the histogram of the other image
    so that the histograms of both after histogram matching are similar (statistically).
  − Hint: check the dimensionality of the input image and include a call to the color
    conversion function if the image has three channels at the start of the histogram
    matching function so that the function deals with color and grayscale images.
• Save the resulting image after the histogram matching into an image file (e.g., using the
  function imwrite)
